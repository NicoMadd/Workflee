## Proposed Schemas :construction:

### Graph Based

#### Roadmap :rocket:

##### Develop a Graph based architecture in which a user can move through nodes.

1. Create a graph **Graph**
2. Graph has a number of nodes **Node**
3. Nodes have a relationship with other nodes **Relation**
4. User can use this graph and know in which node they are. **Mapping**
5. User can move through nodes **Transition**
6. A node can be of a specific type indicating their behaviour **Generic Node**
7. Node difference an incoming node from an outcoming one.
8. Nodes have Transition restrictions **Transition**
